## Overview
This project constructs a structured firm-year panel of S&P 500 companies from 2003 to 2023, integrating board diversity, financial performance, and ESG disclosures from WRDS and third-party sources. It is designed to support empirical research in corporate governance, ESG, and board diversity.

### Data Sources:
- **BoardEx (North America)**: Director-level demographics and board service data
- **Compustat (Fundamentals Annual)**: Financial accounting and market-based metrics
- **Refinitiv & Bloomberg**: ESG scores and historical S&P 500 membership
- **WRDS Cloud**: PostgreSQL backends and Python JupyterHub for computation

## Key Files

### ‚úÖ `master_panel_deduplicated.csv`
**Final merged and deduplicated panel** with one row per firm-year. This is the primary dataset for analysis, missingness diagnostics, and regression modelling.

#### Core Variables
| Variable                        | Description                                                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gvkey`, `ticker`, `conm`        | Compustat identifiers and company metadata                   |
| `fiscal_year`                    | Fiscal year (used for merging and aggregation)               |
| `numberdirectors`               | Board size (BoardEx, from annual report)                     |
| `pct_female_directors`          | Fraction of female directors (BoardEx-derived)               |
| `estimated_num_female_directors`| Approximated count of women on board                         |
| `avg_age`, `stdev_age`          | Age statistics for board directors                           |
| `tobins_q`, `roa`, `liquidity_ratio`, `leverage_ratio` | Financial ratios (Compustat)     |
| `ref_ESGScore`, `bbg_SOCIAL_SCORE` | ESG scores from Refinitiv and Bloomberg                    |

### üìÑ `sp500_panel_with_diversity.csv`
**Intermediate file**: contains governance and financial variables prior to merging with Bloomberg and Refinitiv ESG data.

### üìÑ `director_level_data_filtered.csv`
Director-year-level data filtered from BoardEx, used to compute firm-level diversity stats.

### üìÑ `boardex_director_diversity_by_company_year.csv`
Intermediate file: company-year aggregates of gender and age diversity from BoardEx.

## Construction Workflow

### `wrds_sp500_data.qmd`
A **Quarto notebook** orchestrating the initial pipeline:
1. Extracts and cleans BoardEx director data
2. Joins Compustat financials by `gvkey` and fiscal year
3. Filters companies by point-in-time S&P 500 membership
4. Outputs `sp500_panel_full_with_diversity.csv` as an intermediate dataset

### `merge_with_refinitiv_bloomberg.py`
A **Python script** for final panel construction:
- Reads `sp500_panel_full_with_diversity.csv`
- Merges Bloomberg and Refinitiv ESG data
- Deduplicates based on `gvkey` and `fiscal_year`
- Outputs **`master_panel_deduplicated.csv`** as the final panel

---

## Time Coverage
- **Years**: 2003‚Äì2023 (only  for wrds data)
- **Universe**: S&P 500 constituents at each year-end (via Refinitiv/Bloomberg)

---

## Sample Size
- Over 12,000 unique firm-year observations (only for wrds data)
- One row per `(gvkey, fiscal_year)`
- Restricted to S&P 500 members during each fiscal year

## Missing Data and Regression Inputs

A key concern in panel-based empirical research is variable completeness across firm-years. The final dataset, `master_panel_deduplicated.csv`, integrates financial, governance, and ESG indicators, with varying coverage by source.

To aid transparency, we conducted a targeted missingness analysis for **regression-relevant variables**, including:

- Tobin‚Äôs Q (multiple sources)
- Liquidity and leverage ratios
- Board gender diversity
- ESG summary scores

### üìä Missingness Matrix: Regression Inputs

![](data/regression_vars_missing_matrix.png)

> **White lines = present data**, **Black lines = missing data** across 1,000 random observations (rows) and 22 key variables (columns).

**Columns are rotated** for readability and include variables like:

- `ref_TobinsQ`, `wrds_tobins_q`, `bbg_TOBIN_Q`
- `ref_ROATotalAssetsPercent`, `wrds_roa`

- `wrds_pct_female_directors`, `bbg_PCT_WOMEN`, `ref_FemaleonBoard`

- ESG scores: `ref_ESGScore`, `bbg_ESG_SCORE`, `ref_ESGControversiesScore`

This visual highlights:

- Good coverage from **Refinitiv** and **WRDS (Compustat)** for core financials

- Sparse coverage from **Bloomberg**, especially on board metrics and ESG disclosures

- Some redundancy across data providers (e.g. Tobin‚Äôs Q from WRDS, Refinitiv, Bloomberg)

### Summary: Variable Coverage for Regression

| Type           | Fields (examples)                                       | Coverage         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **High**       | `ref_TobinsQ`, `ref_ROATotalAssetsPercent`, `ref_LeverageRatio`, `wrds_pct_female_directors`, `numberdirectors` | ‚úÖ Broad coverage |
| **Moderate**   | `wrds_tobins_q`, `wrds_roa`, `wrds_leverage_ratio`, `avg_age`, `stdev_age`                      | ‚ö† Some gaps      |
| **Low**        | Bloomberg ESG metrics (e.g. `bbg_PCT_WOMEN`, `bbg_ESG_SCORE`)                          | ‚ùå Sparse         |
